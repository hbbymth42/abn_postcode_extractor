# ABN Postcode Extractor
A Data Pipeline to extract Postcodes from the [Australian Business Number (ABN)](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/abn-bulk-extract) Bulk Extract provided by the Australia Business Register (ABR).

This is a component of a larger project but this could easily become a further project in itself!

The larger project this links to can be found [here](https://github.com/hbbymth42/corporate_tax_transparency_analysis)!

For more information around the structure of the ABN Bulk Extract, refer to the documentation [here](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/abn-bulk-extract). :)
